        I usually don't travel that much because of my strict schedule. As a student I hardly have any time for traveling. But when I was younger I had visited a very special place. The reason I called the place special is because it holds a significant place in ours lives as a muslim. So the place I visited was Makkah and Medina.

   <div> I don't really have any pics of visiting that place. So adding some pics of the recent meal I had with my friends. </div>
